#Automatic Table of Content for study in this project (not lc0 site workflow)
Use some kind of humand readable sub domain limited site-mapping software, script
to generate a table of content of existing documentation from official URLs

#Manual search for non centralized fragments

wikis from forked main lc0 repositories

manual search from accessible blog site, the gap filling entries from start date of that new blog
  list of corresponding URLs here.

find whereabouts of old blog, its archive, or a copy of its content, somehow. 
(as per my last blog browsing, the links to archived blog were dead or broken).

for each of above dispersed sources of documentation, 
    if containing links make link TOC like using above automatisation tools
    otherwise just add URL to final link TOC of inventory (started above).
