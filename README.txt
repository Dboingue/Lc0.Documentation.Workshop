# Top Topics Level
Above all: 
UI for repo editor is the oldest not yet updated with same goodies as Issues
Therefore, Use Issues when creating your first markdown files, it has a toolbar (for us dummies).
Documentation research workshop,  
All topics in one version,
Tentative WIP,
Ideas welcome (via Issues).
+ Notices:
- Not yet submitted to leelachesszero developpers (any plaform)
- Part of efforts mentioned, proposed and suggested in the lc0 google forum by DBg
- Result of considering the google forum and Discord as alternative base plaforms.
- Initial Choice of top topics by Dboingue, in case no other contributors.
- Room for more via Issues and Collaboration, in case contributors
- Many commitment contributory levels: 
  - Issues don't need permission only a Github account, AFAIK.

+ Concerns met by this choice of platform:
- Versioning, open source (content) protection, stable repository, collaboration flow,
visibility, hyperlink based topic and discussion consistency, centralisation (of links),
- threadability at many level
- cross-link mechanisms allowing easy tracking back and forward though 
web of content and discussions related to documenting the lc0 project.

- placeholder folder for unforseen but welcome contributed Tocis as
