###### Top Topics Level
Research toward improving and contributing to the lc0 official documentation.
Building on existing content.  
Aiming at joining official documentation workflow, as past of the objectives.
Using GitHub repository folder hierarchies for topic hierarchies and Issues as corresponding trackable discussions

+ Notices:
- Not yet submitted to leelachesszero developpers (any plaform)
- Part of efforts mentioned, proposed and suggested in the lc0 google forum by DBg
- Result of considering the google forum and Discord as alternative base plaforms.
- Initial Choice of top topics by Dboingue, in case no other contributors.
- Room for more via Issues and Collaboration, in case contributors
- Many commitment contributory levels: 
  - Issues don't need permission only a Github account, AFAIK.
  - Becoming contributor add branches for new Topics
  - Creating a fork, and creating branches there
  - All of the above depending on tasks
  - We ask that issues be tried first, please, as we believe in the strength of discussions

+ Concerns met by this choice of platform:
  - Versioning, open source (content) protection, stable repository, collaboration flow,
    visibility, hyperlink based topic and discussion consistency, centralisation (of links),
  - threadability at many level
  - cross-link mechanisms allowing easy tracking back and forward though 
    web of content and discussions related to documenting the lc0 project.

Here TOC of Topics hierarchy
+ here should be the echo of the folder structure as representing topic 
  - using github existing apps about directory tree printing
  - why not write it manually here, and fix the folder laters?
  - TOC also clickable linking to target folder or file
  - placeholder folder for unforseen but welcome contributed Tocis as
  
+ How to start if considering helping this project: 
  - UI for repo editor is the oldest not yet updated with same goodies as Issues UI
    - Use Issues when creating your first markdown files, it has a toolbar (for us dummies).
  - Once familiar with markdown, 
    - convert readme.txt to markdown, readme.md, it will then show at folder level
    - or convert the issue to some repo directory level Readme.md if sub-topic
